YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that efficiently processes images in a single pass. By dividing images into grids, it simultaneously predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities, making it ideal for applications. Implemented YOLO using the API for streamlined training and inference.
